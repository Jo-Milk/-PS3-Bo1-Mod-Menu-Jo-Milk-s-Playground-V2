The goal of this menu was to utilize the fastfiles to save most memory for the sprx to run smoothly 
I also was testing using custom patch_mp.ff and custom ui_mp.ff
I use gsc hooks by adding new functions that are defined in the sprx 
using iMCSx gsc loader 



The biggest failure is utilizing CSC for non-host aimbot.

This is by far the worst non-host and honestly I don't enjoy non-host as it's just cheating and not modding
